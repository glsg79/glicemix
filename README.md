# Glicemix
A simple diabetes diary
### What's this crap?
Glicemix is an ambitious idea I had when I realized that among all those similar applications to manage my pathology, there is no one that do what I really need.

Rants aside, the final goal here is to create a relatively simple diary (using Python and Gtk) to keep track of all healt data, and more, that are relevant.

By now I'm just experimenting with some function to manipulate what I have, trying to learn so mething in the process.

If you are ended up here and want to help me, or drop me a line, please feel free to do so, I will really appreciate.

I know this is not a *real* README file, but I will fix it as this project takes shape.

TODO Change to rst file type
