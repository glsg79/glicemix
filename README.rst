Glicemix
========
A simple personal diary for diabetes management


What's this crap?
-----------------
Glicemix, from the italian word *glicemia* that stands for "blood sugar level",
is my attempt to create a simple diary to track my pathology with a super simple
application.
There are a bunch of apps like this out there, but I wanted one that does just
what I need and I'd like it to be free and opensource.

By now I'm just experimenting with some function to manipulate what I have
trying to learn something in the process.

My goal is to have something modular so one can add plugins to i.e. import
from different sources or glucose meters.
I will try to add support for mine, but for now I started simply importing a
file exported from the official (proprietary and crappy) application made for
it.

If you are ended up here and want to help me, or drop me a line, please feel
free to do so, I will really appreciate.

I know this is not a *real* README file, but I will fix it as this project
takes shape.
